# Readme_Generator


## Description 

Tired of creating readme files? This app is for you! I created this app to make it easier for developers to create readme files by answering some questions. The app will take care of the formatting for you, all you have to do is answer the questions. This will help save you time and allow you to focus on working on your project instead of spending time creating and updating a readme file.
